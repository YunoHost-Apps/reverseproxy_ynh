## Overview

This application allows to configure a HTTP(S) reverse proxy to serve another web service, as well as an (optional) static assets directory to serve directly from nginx. The application appears as a tile in the SSOWat panel, unless configured otherwise after install. The access to the application can be made public.

The supported backends are:

- plaintext HTTP to localhost (127.x.x.x)
- HTTPS to any destination
- socket file on local disk

Please be aware that SSOWat sends user credentials in plaintext to the backend, so do not use this application to reverse-proxy a service you don't trust (for example to mirror a site hosted by someone else).


**Shipped version:** 0.2~ynh2
